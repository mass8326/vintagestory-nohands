# NoHands

Many actions in the game require a free hand to perform. Now you can press a hotkey (R by default) in order to move your currently held item stack into a backpack slot! Especially useful when cooking a lot of meals, taking from pit kilns, or managing piles.

Use [CarryOn](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/4405) and need both of your hands free? There's a hotkey (Shift + R by default) for that too.

Want more drastic changes to make your inventory management even better? Consider using my other mod: [PickupArtist](https://mods.vintagestory.at/pickupartist)

## Technical Info

Either hotkey can be changed in the settings menu once you are in a world. It will not show up in the main menu's settings option.

This is a purely client-side mod, so it should work on servers that don't have it installed.

Should work perfectly with any [.net 7 build](https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/v1188-rc1-the-plunge-to-net7-r362/) as well.
